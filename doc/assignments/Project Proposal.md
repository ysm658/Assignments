# Statement of problem
- **Purpose**: Clearly define the problem that your project aims to solve.
- **Content**:
	- **Background**: Provide context about the problem. Why is it relevant? What organizational challenges exist that create this problem?
	- **Data Context**: Describe what kind of data is involved in this problem. Is it data that is not readily accessible or data that is not in a usable format?
	- **Impact of Problem**: Explain how this problem negatively impacts the organization or users.
# Proposed solution
- **Purpose**: Describe the technical solution you plan to implement to address the problem.
- **Content**:
	- If you are **scraping data**, specify:
		- What websites you plan to scrape and the types of data you will collect (e.g., product reviews, news articles, etc.).
		- How you will ensure the data is collected ethically and legally (e.g., obeying terms of service, using appropriate delays between requests).
	- If you are doing **data transformation**, detail:
		- The source of the data (e.g., websites, CSV files, API feeds).
		- The kind of transformations you will perform (e.g., cleaning, aggregating, joining data tables).
		- How the transformed data will be stored (e.g., relational database, cloud storage).
	- **Tools and Techniques**: Describe the programming languages, libraries, and databases you’ll use (e.g., Python with BeautifulSoup or Scrapy for scraping, pandas for transformation, SQLite or PostgreSQL for storage).
	- **Architecture**: Include a description of the data pipeline architecture. For example:
		• “Web scraping using Scrapy → Data cleaning using pandas → Storage in SQLite database.”
	- **Data Output**: What form will the final data take? Will it be a dashboard, a report, an API, or something else?
# Value proposal
- **Purpose**: Explain how your solution creates value for the organization.
- **Content**:
	- **Efficiency**: How will the solution save time or resources? For instance, will it reduce the time spent on manual data entry or eliminate redundant processes?
	- **Insights**: Describe the insights or information that will become available. Will this data enable better decision-making, improve user experience, or identify new business opportunities?
	- **Return on Investment (ROI)**: If possible, quantify the expected benefits. If not, provide a qualitative argument.
	- **Strategic Value**: How does the solution align with the organization’s broader goals (e.g., enhancing customer service, driving sales, expanding market reach)?
# Timeline and resources
- **Purpose**: Provide a realistic plan for implementing the solution, along with the resources required.
- **Content**:
	- **Timeline**: Create a clear timeline, breaking the project into phases with estimated completion dates.
	- **Example**:
		- Week 1-2: Data source analysis and planning.
		- Week 3-4: Data collection (e.g., web scraping).
		- Week 5-6: Data transformation and cleaning.
		- Week 7: Data storage and integration.
		- Week 8: Testing and validation.
		- Week 9-10: Report creation and presentation.
- **Resources**:
	- **Human Resources**: How many team members are needed, and what skills should they have (e.g., data scraping, data engineering)?
	- **Software and Hardware**: List the tools and any infrastructure needed (e.g., cloud servers, databases).
	- **Data Access**: Ensure that you have access to the data sources or any required APIs.
