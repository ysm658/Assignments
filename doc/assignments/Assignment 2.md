This assignment is meant to test your knowledge of:
- loading a file from disk into a in-memory data structure
- using several data types in python
- doing a basic text manipulation

I have provided a paragraph for you to parse in *data/assignment_2/paragraph.txt*. I want you to read this text into memory in Python and
1. Split the text into sentences.
2. Create a list of words (without whitespace or punctuation)
3. Create a set of words
4. Find the hidden message in the **list** of words at indexes \[60, 26, 10, 10, 41, 35, 26, 44,48\]

Please turn in your code with answers commented in line, like:
print(number_of_sentences) # 5
print(unique_word_count) #23
print(hidden_message) #"HIDDENMESSAGE"
