# Data Wrangling 304
*Spring 2025*
Meets: TR 9:45-11:00 {location t.b.d.}
Instructor: Ephy Love elove4@utk.edu
Office Hours: TR 8:45-9:45 (before class)

***Note: this is the first time this course is being taught. I am sending out a pre-class survey which we will discuss on the first day of the course. The main strokes of the following document will not change, but the finer details are flexible until we agree on a syllabus in week 1.***
## Course Description
This course covers the all-important data “wrangling” process, taking data from real-world sources and converting the data into easily-accessible format for analysis. The course covers the steps of the data wrangling process like importing data, tidying data, string processing, HTML parsing, working with dates and times, and text mining. We will consider databases as well as data extracted from documents.
## Prerequisites
The only pre-requisite for this course is some sort of course with programming. Familiarity with a high level programming language such as Python or R will be very helpful.
## Course Objective
After you have completed this course, you should feel comfortable taking on data analysis and data science tasks with arbitrary data sources. It won't matter to you how complicated and messy the data are, you'll have an instinctive toolset to reach for.
Specifically, we will cover:
1. Why we automate data wrangling
2. How we automate data wrangling
3. Structured vs unstructured data
4. Experimental data analysis
5. Cleaning data (fine-tuning)
6. Independent project development
In the final project for this course you will develop a data-driven solution to a real-world problem. You will be able to explain the architecture of your solution and how you maximized value with the tools and time provided in the course. You will present your work to your peers in a final demonstration.
## Required Materials
A laptop. Please reach out ASAP if you would like my help getting a computer from the library.

## Assignments and Assessments
### Homework
Homework assignments must be turned in to Canvas on-time (5 PM on the due-date) to receive any credit. If you have a reason you must turn an assignment in late, contact me as early as possible so that we can discuss.
### Final Project
Roughly 1/3 of course credit comes from your final project and its proposal. Your project will require you choosing from a set of unstructured/semi-structured datasets (websites, encyclopedias, open datasets)\*, and creating a 10 minute presentation demonstrating:
1. Your approach to organizing your data and code
2. Any tricky cleaning that had to be done
3. An interesting insight you gleaned from the data
I will grade this work as if I am your supervisor in an internship, and you are telling me why I should offer you a job in the summer. You will be graded on the complete package: organization, presentation and utility of the knowledge you bring to the class.

\* If you would like to use a dataset outside of the suggested sources, you must get approval prior to beginning work on your proposal/
### Attendance
Show up to class, pay attention, participate here and there, and get 20% of course points. The final few weeks of the course will be dedicated to your projects and you will have my time in class for any questions or support I can provide.
### General expectations
*Be respectful of your peers and I*.
*Keep phones away and on silent.*
*Do the work.*
*If you can, help someone else.*
	If you meet these expectations, I will do everything I can to help you be successful.
## Grading Policy
This class is graded out of 100 possible points. If you do all of the homework and show up to class, you will pass. If you want high marks, you should be focused on your final project early and use office hours to begin planning and work.
